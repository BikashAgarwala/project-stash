Stash is a self-hosted, universal inbox designed to capture, organize, and retrieve your digital life. It's the solution to the endless stream of links, notes, images, and documents you send yourself across different apps.

## The Problem

Tired of emailing links to yourself or creating a WhatsApp group for one? We often need to save small bits of information‚Äîa code snippet, a link to an article, a quick note, or an inspiring image. These items end up scattered across various platforms, making them difficult to find when you need them most. Stash solves this by providing one central, secure, and searchable place for everything.

## Core Features

* **‚úÖ Universal Capture:** Save text snippets and links through a clean web interface.
* **‚úÖ Secure Authentication:** Sign in quickly and securely with your Google account using OAuth2.
* **‚úÖ Centralized Dashboard:** A single, clean dashboard to view and manage all your saved items.
* **‚è∞ Quick-Capture Extension (v1.1):** A browser extension to save content from anywhere on the web with a single click.
* **‚è∞ Rich Content Support (v1.2):** Upload images, PDFs, and other files directly to your vault.
* **üß† AI-Powered Search (Phase 2):** Future plans include OCR for text in images and semantic search to find things based on meaning, not just keywords.
